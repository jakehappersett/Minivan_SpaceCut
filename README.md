# Minivan SpaceCut

![Minivan Space Cut](img/MiniVan_SpaceCut.jpg)

Simple Minivan case with a cutout for reversed spacebars.  I've included two sets of stl files:  

+ Unbroken case for large format printers
+ Logically split case for smaller print beds

## Assembly

This case can be assembled using M2.5 screws screwed directly into the plastic.  While this does work and holds the case together decently it is probably a better idea to use heat set inserts to mount the screws to.
